# Chinese-Grammatical-Error-Correction-System
My undergraduate thesis in 2022 at Shanghai University

## Introduction
Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important Natural Language Processing task, which aims to detect and correct errors in text, such as spelling, grammar and punctuation. 

English GEC techniques started early in the 1960s. It mainly focuses on words, and errors can be divided into two categories: first, 
- Non-word error. The word does not exist, for example, "bag" is misspelled as "bga". 
- Real word error. The word exists but does not fit the context, for example, 'bag' is misspelled as 'bad'. Real word error is a contextual error related to grammar and semantics, and is a major challenge in text correction. 

This project studies Chinese GEC algorithms and develops a Text Error Correction System.
